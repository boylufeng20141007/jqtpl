## 2.0.0
- Dropped compatibility to the original engine, as it is not any more developed
- Make API nicer:
  - jqtpl.tmpl -> jqtpl.render
  - jqtpl.render returns always a string.
  - jqtpl.template -> jqtpl.compile
  - jqtpl.tempalte[name] -> jqtpl.cache[name]
- Make {{each}} tag [].forEach compatible - pass value as first, iteration as a second argument.
- Rename {{tmpl}} tag to {{partial}}.
- For those who has implemented custom tags:
    - For less conflicts renamed:
        - "_" -> "__res"
        - "$1" -> "__1"
        - "$2" -> "__2"
        - "$1a" -> "__1a"
        - "$data" -> "__data"
    - Removed $data and $item local variables in tempaltes.
- Port unit tests from original engine.
- Add browser and AMD support
- Added support express 3.0.x
