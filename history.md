## 2.0.0
- Dropped compatibility to the original engine, as it is not any more developed
- Make API nicer:

  - jqtpl.render returns always a string.
  - jqtpl.template -> jqtpl.compile
  - jqtpl.tempalte[name] -> jqtpl.cache[name]
- Make {{each}} tag [].forEach compatible - pass value as first, iteration as a second argument.
- Rename {{tmpl}} tag to {{partial}}.
- Port unit tests from original engine.
- Add browser and AMD support
- Added support express 3.0.x
